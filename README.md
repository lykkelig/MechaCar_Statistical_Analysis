# Module 15 - Statistics and R

## Overview of Project
The data analytics team is to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

## Analysis Using R Studio
* [Atomic:] Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* [Atomic:] Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* [Atomic:] Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* [Atomic:] Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Summary  End Result
* [Atomic:] Lot1: The two means are not statistically different so we do NOT reject the NULL hypothesis.
* [Atomic:] Lot2: The p value is greater than 0.05 so we do NOT reject the NULL hypothesis.
* [Atomic:] Lot3: The two means ARE statistically different and the p value is less than 0.05 so we 
				  REJECT the NULL hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis.
